# Universal-Foreign-Language-Flashcards
Repository containing Anki Flashcards &amp; source code to hopefully learn/revise any language

## Introduction
This repository has taken words outlined in the vocabulary section of each chapter of the [Francais Interactif](http://www.laits.utexas.edu/fi/) language program and put them into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. All the vocabulary from each chapter has been arranged in a way that can be easily learnt from Anki, separated into decks for each chapter
2. Any updates, corrections or translations to the deck will be available at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/Universal-Foreign-Language-Flashcards">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Universal-Foreign-Language-Flashcards</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.
3. Modifications from the original work includes typo correction, card merging & consistency consolidation (see the commit history for [fr-en] for the specific changes)

Feel free to share the deck and give the repository a star so more people are likely to see this work and can get the most out of it.

## Usage
If you want to just learn the words, download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> on your device of choice and open the .apkg file to add it into your collection. You can choose to download the whole texbook as a single deck or you can download it a chapter at a time from the individual chapter files in the "APKG" folder for the relevant language pair. If you wish to build the deck from scratch you will need to import the .txt file via the desktop with HTML enabled and the separator to be "|".

## Potential Improvements Yet to be Made
1. To find a way to systematically pull the pronounciation of each word or phrase from the audio provided in the textbook.
    - Currently audio from the textbook are batched together and are not word by word, we are looking into splitting these programmatically & appending them to each card
    - Anki has an addon for pronounciation called "AwesomeTTS" but I am unsure of the license which the audio can be used under.
2. To be able to automatically sort the cards so that the words which are used most in the vocabulary (or the textbook as a whole) is displayed first for the user to learn.
3. We would like to be able to translate these decks for different languages so other people who don't speak English or French can learn these words or be able to make textbooks for other languages as well.

## Contributing
Pull requests, corrections, translations & fixes are welcome. Any contributions must be submitted under the same license that the original piece of work (see below). Take a look at any open issues or submit new ones if there is something that needs to be fixed or added.

### Translating for other languages
Translations in all languages are welcome. Send a pull request or open an issue any time of day or night.

**Please prepend the tag `[lang-code-lang-code]` to your issues and pull requests.** For example, `[fr-en]` for French-English. This will help everyone pick out things they care about.

We're happy for any contribution in any form, but if you're making more than one major change (i.e. translations for two different languages) it would be super cool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so that someone can review them more effectively and/or individually.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more guidance and details for making a contribution.
